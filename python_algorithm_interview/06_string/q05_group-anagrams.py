49. Group Anagrams
https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

        for word in strs:
            anagrams[''.join(sorted(word))].append(word)

        return anagrams.values()

solution = Solution()
strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
